## Description

The Arlecchino Key Generator is a Node.js module designed to produce unique keys with a touch of Arlecchino's charm. It utilizes cryptographic functions to generate a random UUID, shuffles its characters, inserts the phrase "Arlecchino" in the middle, and then encodes a random 7-character substring of the resulting key using Base64 encoding.

## Why Use This Module?

Idk, I created this module in my free time from work, use it if you're a Genshin player and a simp of Arlecchino like me lmao (I got her C6 btw).
